Demo Android application of the Katana dependency injection library.

This demo application showcases the usage of Katana on Android. It also demonstrates how UI 
([Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/)) tests can be performed along
with Katana and mocking. Please see `MainEspressoTest`. 

Additionally to dependency injection the demo uses the
[Model-view-presenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) 
(MVP) pattern to better showcase the capabilities of Katana.
